## Description

I spend a lot of time on my computer, and often I lose track of how much time I spend on different websites. This habit has had a negative effect on both my productivity and health.  

That‚Äôs why I created **WebTime** ‚Äî a Chrome Extension that tracks your browsing activity live, shows you exactly how much time you‚Äôve spent on each site, and lets you set **time limits per website**.  

When you cross a limit, WebTime reminds you with a notification so you can take control of your screen time.  

This extension can help you:
- Reduce distractions
- Manage productivity
- Take breaks and avoid burnout  

You can also easily tweak it to fit your own usage style.

> Note: This project was built as a personal productivity tool and submitted as part of my CS50 journey.
